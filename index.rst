The Pylons Project Documentation

packages intended for use with pyramid_. This is the home for the
documentation for all of these projects.

Mailing List and Online
-----------------------

Development questions related to Pylons projects can be discussed on the 
`pylons-dev mail list <http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-devel/>`_.

On IRC, Pylons developers are generally available on the ``#pylons`` channel
on the `Freenode IRC Network <http://freenode.net/>`_.

.. note::
    
    *Try to spend some time solving a problem yourself before asking others
    for help.* 
    While it can be tempting to jump straight to IRC to ask for help, many
    problems can be solved by yourself. Giving it a shot first on your own,
    will be less imposing on others you ask for help.

FAQ
---

For Pylons users coming from Pylons 1, the change to a new core package might
raise some questions regarding how to proceed, what it means for existing
Pylons application, and more.

Likewise for users of repoze.bfg (the older name for Pyramid), some questions
need to be answered.
