The Pylons Project
==================

The Pylons Project develops a collection of related web development technologies.

Visit our organization website for information about projects under the Pylons Project.

http://pylonsproject.org/

This web page's only purpose is to provide an organization and canonical URL on Read the Docs for documentation of each project under the Pylons Project. Previously it was used for marketing purposes as well, but all that content now resides at the appropriate website for the organization or project.
