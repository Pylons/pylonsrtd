The Pylons Project
==================

The Pylons Project develops a collection of related web development technologies.

Visit our websites for information about projects under the Pylons Project as well as the organization itself.

* http://pylonsproject.org/ for the Pylons Project
* https://trypyramid.com/ for Pyramid, the web framework
* http://webob.org/ for WebOb
* http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-webframework/en/latest/ for Pylons, the web framework

This web page (and the project `PylonsRTD <https://github.com/Pylons/pylonsrtd/>`_) serves as a root domain for documentation of Pylons Project projects on Read the Docs. Previously it was used for marketing purposes as well, but that content now resides at the appropriate website for the organization or project.
