Support
-------

Development questions related to Pylons projects can be discussed on the 
`pylons-devel mail list <http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-devel/>`_.

On IRC, Pylons developers are generally available on the ``#pylons`` channel
on the `Freenode IRC Network <http://freenode.net/>`_.

.. topic:: Using Support Wisely

   Before asking a technical question on the maillist(s) or in IRC, please
   make sure to try the following things (paraphrased from `Before You Ask
   <http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before>`_):

   - Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

   - Try to find an answer by searching the maillist archives.

   - Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

   - Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

   - If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source
     code.

   After exhausing these avenues, it's completely appropriate to ask a
   question on the Pylons-devel maillist or #pylons IRC channel.  When you
   ask your question, please describe what you've learned from the efforts
   above, as it will help the developers focus on answering your question
   quickly.  It also helps tremendously if you are able to provide a code or
   configuration snippet that makes the problem easily repeatable.
