Pyramid Documentation
=====================

Getting Started
---------------

If you are new to Pyramid, we have a few resources that can help you get up to
speed right away:

* For help getting Pyramid set up, try the
  `install guide <pyramid_install.html>`_. 

.. * To get the feel for how Pyramid works, go to the
..   `quick tutorial <pyramid_quick_tutorial.html>`_ page. 

* Coming from Pylons? You might want to check out the `Akhet documentation
  <http://sluggo.scrapping.cc/python/Akhet/index.html>`_.  Akhet is a
  Pyramid-based development environment that works more like Pylons than
  "raw" Pyramid does.

* Once you are a little more comfortable with Pyramid, you might want to code
  along to the `wiki tutorial
  <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/1.0/tutorials/wiki2/index.html>`_.

* If you require support or are looking for immediate answers,  you may want
  to consult our `FAQ <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/faq/pyramid.html>`_ first,
  then probably try our mailing lists or visit our IRC channels, #pyramid or
  #pylons. 

Main Documentation
------------------

* Comprehensive documentation:

  * `Pyramid documentation 1.0 </projects/pyramid/1.0/>`_ (`PDF
    <http://static.pylonsproject.org/pyramid-1.0.pdf>`_) (`Epub
    <http://static.pylonsproject.org/pyramid-1.0.epub>`_) narrative and API
    documentation for Pyramid's currently released version.

  * We are always working on improving both Pyramid and its documentation. If
    you are using an unrealeased version of Pyramid you might need to
    consult the `development documentation </projects/pyramid/dev/>`_.

* `The Pyramid Cookbook
  <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_cookbook/dev/>`_ presents
  topical, practical usages of Pyramid.  Unfinished.
