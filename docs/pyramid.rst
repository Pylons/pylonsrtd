Pyramid Development Environment Documentation
---------------------------------------------

Development environments are packages which use Pyramid as a core, but offer
alternate services and scaffolding.  Each development environment presents a
set of opinions and a "personality" to its users.  Although users of a
development environment can still use all of the services offered by the
Pyramid core, they are usually guided to a more focused set of opinions
offered by the development environment itself.  Development environments
often have dependencies beyond those of the Pyramid core.

.. _akhet-desc:

* `Akhet </projects/akhet/dev/>`_: Akhet is an application scaffolding for
  Pyramid that's closer to the Pylons 1 style than Pyramid's built-in
  scaffolding. The manual also tries to be a gentler introduction to Pyramid
  for those from a Pylons-ish background.

  - Maintained by: Mike Orr

  - Version Control: https://bitbucket.org/sluggo/akhet

* `Khufu Project <http://khufuproject.github.com/>`_: Khufu is an application
  scaffolding for Pyramid that provides an environment to work with Jinja2 and
  SQLAlchemy.
