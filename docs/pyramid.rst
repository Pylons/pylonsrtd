Sample Applications
===================

.. note::

   These applications run only on Python 2.x, and so do some of their
   dependencies.

`cluegun <https://github.com/Pylons/cluegun>`_ is a simple pastebin
application based on Rocky Burt's `ClueBin
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ClueBin/0.2.3>`_.  It demonstrates form
processing, security, and the use of :term:`ZODB` within a :app:`Pyramid`
application.  Check this application out via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/cluegun.git

`virginia <https://github.com/Pylons/virginia>`_ is a very simple dynamic
file rendering application.  It is willing to render structured text
documents, HTML documents, and images from a filesystem directory.
It's also a good example of :term:`traversal`. An
earlier version of this application runs the `repoze.org
<http://repoze.org>`_ website.  Check this application out via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/virginia.git

`shootout <https://github.com/Pylons/shootout>`_ is an example "idea
competition" application by Carlos de la Guardia and Lukasz Fidosz.  It
demonstrates :term:`URL dispatch`, simple authentication, integration
with `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ and ``pyramid_simpleform``.
Check this application out of version control via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/shootout.git

`KARL <http://karlproject.org>`_ is a moderately-sized application (roughly
80K lines of Python code) built on top of :app:`Pyramid`.  It is an open
source web system for collaboration, organizational intranets, and knowledge
management. It provides facilities for wikis, calendars, manuals, searching,
tagging, commenting, and file uploads.  See the `KARL site
<http://karlproject.org>`_ for download and installation details.

.. _akhet-desc:

`Khufu Project <http://khufuproject.github.com/>`_: Khufu is an application
scaffolding for Pyramid that provides an environment to work with Jinja2 and
SQLAlchemy.
