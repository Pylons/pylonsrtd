  organizational intranets, and knowledge management. It provides facilities
  for wikis, calendars, manuals, searching, tagging, commenting, and file
  uploads.  See the `KARL site <http://karlproject.org>`_ for download and
  installation details.

.. _sample_pyramid_dev_env:

Sample Pyramid Development Environments
---------------------------------------

"Development environments" are packages which use Pyramid as a core, but offer
alternate services and scaffolding.  Each development environment presents a
set of opinions and a "personality" to its users.  Although users of a
development environment can still use all of the services offered by the
Pyramid core, they are usually guided to a more focused set of opinions
offered by the development environment itself.  Development environments
often have dependencies beyond those of the Pyramid core.

`Akhet <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/akhet/en/latest/>`_
  A Pyramid library and demo application with a Pylons-like feel. Its most
  known for its former application scaffold, which helped users transition
  from Pylons and those preferring a more Pylons-like API. The scaffold has
  been retired but the demo plays a similar role.

`Khufu Project <http://khufuproject.github.com/>`_
  Khufu is an application scaffolding for Pyramid that provides an environment
  to work with Jinja2 and SQLAlchemy.

  - Maintained by: Rocky Burt
  - Version Control: https://github.com/khufuproject
