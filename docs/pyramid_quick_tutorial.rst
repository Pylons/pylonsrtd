Pyramid Quick Tutorial
======================

This tutorial is intended to give you a quick overview of the Pyramid Web 
Application Framework. Because Pyramid has few opinions on how to 
organize and develop your application, this tutorial focus on a minimal 
approach with common idioms to get a feel of basic Pyramid patterns.

Here's what you'll get at the end of the session, a minimal application to 
view, insert and close tasks in a list, backed by an SQLite database and using 
the routes pattern to match your URLs to code functions.

Organizing The Project
----------------------

Before getting started, create the folder hierarchy needed for the application:

.. code-block:: text

    /tasks
        /static
        /templates

The tasks folder we just created will not be used as a python package, it'll 
just serves as a container where we'll drop and organize our files for the 
project.
