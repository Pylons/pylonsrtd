Pyramid Denials
===============

This section hopes to alleviate concerns some users may have about using the 
pyramid framework package.

Was ``pyramid`` made in a pyramid?
----------------------------------

Absolutely not, such pyramid was definitely not black, nor did it shoot beams
of light into the sky.

Why isn't there an eye in the pyramid?
--------------------------------------

None of us can afford to pay our Freemasonry dues, thus can't afford to
license the *eye* to put in our pyramid.
