Contributing Source Code and Documentation
==========================================

For substantive contributions to its major projects, The Pylons Project
requires the following of its contributors:

- An assignment of half-ownership of submitted code or documentation for
  substantive contributions to its official projects.  We require the
  assignment because we're interested in, eventually, giving the copyright to
  the code to a foundation.  Obtaining half-ownership of the code makes it
  possible for us to do this credibly without chasing people for permission
  to do so when that time comes.

- Assurance that the contributor will not check in incompatibly-licensed
  code.

- Assurance that the contributor will not allow his submission credentials to
  be used by a third party who may not agree to the constraints of a
  contribution agreement.

- Assurance that the submitted code does not infringe upon or violate the
  rights of a third party.

- Assurance that the contributor understands any licensing exceptions local
  to the repository he is contributing to.

"Signing" a contribution agreement is simple: just add your name and a date
to the bottom of a "CONTRIBUTORS.txt" file found in the root of the Pylons
project you'd like to contribute to.  Optimally, this will be done when you
submit code through GitHub (whether via a pull request from a separate
repository fork, or by direct push if you have push access to the canonical
project repository).  Your intent to abide by the contributor agreement is
signified by your commit to the "CONTRIBUTORS.txt" file with your name and a
date.

Examples of "substantive" contributions:

- Submitting a new feature for review.

- Submitting artwork.

- Submitting a new chapter to documentation.

For bugfixes and other minor contributions, signing the contributor file is
usually not required.  However, the reviewer of a particular submission is
the arbiter of whether that submission requires the signing of the
contributors file.

A sample of the current contributor agreement is reproduced in full below.

    Pylons Project Contributor Agreement
    ====================================

    The submitter agrees by adding his or her name within the section below
    named "Contributors" and submitting the resulting modified document to
    the canonical shared repository location for this software project
    (whether directly, as a user with "direct commit access", or via a "pull
    request"), he or she is signing a contract electronically.  The submitter
    becomes a Contributor after a) he or she signs this document by adding
    their name beneath the "Contributors" section below, and b) the resulting
    document is accepted into the canonical version control repository.

    Treatment of Account
    ---------------------

    Contributor will not allow anyone other than the Contributor to use his
    or her username or source repository login to submit code to a Pylons
    Project source repository. Should Contributor become aware of any such
    use, Contributor will immediately by notifying Agendaless Consulting.
    Notification must be performed by sending an email to
    webmaster@agendaless.com.  Until such notice is received, Contributor
    will be presumed to have taken all actions made through Contributor's
    account. If the Contributor has direct commit access, Agendaless
    Consulting will have complete control and discretion over capabilities
    assigned to Contributor's account, and may disable Contributor's account
    for any reason at any time.

    Legal Effect of Contribution
    ----------------------------

    Upon submitting a change or new work to a Pylons Project source
    Repository (a "Contribution"), you agree to assign, and hereby do assign,
    a one-half interest of all right, title and interest in and to copyright
    and other intellectual property rights with respect to your new and
    original portions of the Contribution to Agendaless Consulting. You and
    Agendaless Consulting each agree that the other shall be free to exercise
    any and all exclusive rights in and to the Contribution, without
    accounting to one another, including without limitation, the right to
    license the Contribution to others under the Repoze Public License. This
    agreement shall run with title to the Contribution. Agendaless Consulting
    does not convey to you any right, title or interest in or to the Program
    or such portions of the Contribution that were taken from the
    Program. Your transmission of a submission to the Pylons Project source
    Repository and marks of identification concerning the Contribution itself
    constitute your intent to contribute and your assignment of the work in
    accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

    License Terms
    -------------

    Code committed to the Pylons Project source repository (Committed Code)
    must be governed by the Repoze Public License
    (http://repoze.org/LICENSE.txt, aka "the RPL") or another license
    acceptable to Agendaless Consulting.  Until Agendaless Consulting
    declares in writing an acceptable license other than the RPL, only the
    RPL shall be used.  A list of exceptions is detailed within the
    "Licensing Exceptions" section of this document, if one exists.

    Representations, Warranty, and Indemnification
    ----------------------------------------------

    Contributor represents and warrants that the Committed Code does not
    violate the rights of any person or entity, and that the Contributor has
    legal authority to enter into this Agreement and legal authority over
    Contributed Code. Further, Contributor indemnifies Agendaless Consulting
    against violations.

    Cryptography
    ------------

    Contributor understands that cryptographic code may be subject to
    government regulations with which Agendaless Consulting and/or entities
    using Committed Code must comply. Any code which contains any of the
    items listed below must not be checked-in until Agendaless Consulting
    staff has been notified and has approved such contribution in writing.

    - Cryptographic capabilities or features

    - Calls to cryptographic features

    - User interface elements which provide context relating to cryptography

    - Code which may, under casual inspection, appear to be cryptographic.

    Notices
    -------

    Contributor confirms that any notices required will be included in any
    Committed Code.

    Licensing Exceptions
    ====================

    None
